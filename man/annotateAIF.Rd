\title{Function to annotate features using LC-MS AIF raw chromatograms.}
\usage{
annotateAIF(
  targetTable = NULL,
  filetype = "mzML",
  libs = "Lipids",
  ESImode = "POS",
  RTfile = "none",
  nCE = 1,
  corThresh1 = 0.8,
  corThresh2 = 0.8,
  checkIsotope = TRUE,
  tolerance = 25,
  maxMZdiff = 0.01,
  matchWeight = 0.5,
  ncandidates = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{targetTable}{A .csv file containing the list of features to annotate
and the name of the files containing the raw data.}

\item{libs}{Fragment libraries to use: 'Lipids' (default) or 'Metabolites'
for other small molecules.}

\item{ESImode}{Ionization mode: 'POS' for positive (default)
or 'NEG' for negative ionisation modes}

\item{RTfile}{Optional csv file with Lipid/metabolites classes Retention
Times in seconds.}

\item{nCE}{Number of Collision Energy levels depending on the MS system used
Waters, Bruker (QToF) and Thermo Orbitrap = 1, Agilent (QToF) > 1, however,
only the highest energy level will be considered}

\item{corThresh1}{Pearson correlation coefficient for MS1 EIC correlation.}

\item{corThresh2}{Pearson correlation coefficient for MS2 EIC correlation.}

\item{checkIsotope}{Whether or not to check the isotope type;
default is set to TRUE}

\item{tolerance}{Tolerance in ppm for the candidate search.}

\item{maxMZdiff}{Maximum m/z difference between candidate fragments and
pseudo-MS/MS or AIF ions in Da.}

\item{matchWeight}{weight of the fragment matches to the final score;
value between 0 and 1; the remaining fraction of the weight comes from the
candidate m/z error.}

\item{ncandidates}{Maximum number of candidates to plot and store.}
}
\value{
For each feature in the targeTable the will return a ranked list of
annotations, a plot of EICs and pseudo-MS/MS spectrum for the matched ions,
a plot of pseudo-MS/MS and pseudo-MS spectra for the each feature,
a targeTable annotated with rank 1 annotations and a table with the options
used for the function.
}
\description{
Search possible matches of a feature in Lipid fragments and other small
molecule libraries, using 'raw' LC-MS single chromatogram information
already loaded and peak-picked.
